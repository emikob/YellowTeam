If you integrate your RStudio with Github, you can automatically commit your code online! This would help looking at each other's answers without having to do a lot of work.

I would recommend following these instructions to install git and connect GitHub to your RStudio:

Each problem sheet folder has everyone's respective names on it. Please save your projects to your folders; however you organize your folder is up to you!
If you want to see each other's codes, I would recommend looking at the .Rmd file in the user folders. You can see the code without having to download anything. Alternatively, you could open the file directly on RStudio, but please be really careful not to change others' codes.
